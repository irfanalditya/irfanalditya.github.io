Hi friend, this year is my third year following Flare-on and is the first time i managed to solve all the challenges. I finished in 276th place as can be seen [here](https://twitter.com/aldityairfan/status/1585159006909526016).
For those of you who don't know what Flare-On is, you can read it [here](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/announcing-ninth-flareon-challenge), is an annual reverse engineering CTF by Mandiant (formerly by FireEye).
