          [ De-virtualization ]# Sometimes malware attempts to hinder reverse engineering by implementing a virtual machine which runs custom bytecode. These challenges are designed to test your ability to reverse engineer &amp;amp; manipulate custom bytecode.
 VM1#Description:
 vm1.exe implements a simple 8-bit virtual machine (VM) to try and stop reverse engineers from retrieving the flag. The VMâ€™s RAM contains the encrypted flag and some bytecode to decrypt it.

          [ Shellcode ]# Position independent code (AKA Shellcode) is assembly code which can simply be copied to a memory location and run. Due to the lack of need for complex loading &amp;amp; initialization, it is popular for many tasks such as code injection. These challenges are designed to test your ability to reverse engineer malware shellcode.
 Shellcode2#Hi, now we are given a PE file named shellcode2.

          [Hide and Seek]#Strings3#Still with the MalwareTech Windows reversing challenge, now we are given a PE file named strings3.exe_.
Also still with the same rules as the previous 2 (this and this), this challenge is static analysis only.
The description:
 strings3.exe contains an un-encrypted flag stored within the executable. When run, the program will output an MD5 hash of the flag but not the original.

          [Hide and Seek]#Strings#Hello friend, back again with the MalwareTech Windows reversing challenge, now we are given a PE file named strings2.exe_.
Same as the previous challenge, we can only use static analysis to solve this challenge.
The description of this challenge:
 strings2.exe contains an un-encrypted flag stored within the executable. When run, the program will output an MD5 hash of the flag but not the original.

          [Hide and Seek]#Strings#Hello friend, in this challenge we are given a PE file named strings1.exe_ . The rule of this challenge is that we can only use static analysis to solve it, that&amp;rsquo;s why there is &amp;ldquo;_&amp;rdquo; at the end of the PE file name, which is to prevent us from accidentally running it.
The description of this challenge:
 strings1.exe contains an un-encrypted flag stored within the executable.
